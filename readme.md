## Setup

Before running linting, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install react-video-call
yarn add react-video-call

```

## Running Linting

To run the app process, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

```


## Configuration

The project's configurations are defined in the `.eslintrc.js` file located in the project's root directory. This file contains rules settings, plugin configurations, and other options that dictate how ESLint should analyze and enforce coding standards in your project.



## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines automate the linting process, ensuring that code changes adhere to linting standards before merging them into the main codebase. CI tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI can be configured to run linting checks automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project is much appreciated.
